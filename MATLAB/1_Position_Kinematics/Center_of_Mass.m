% THADDEUS IS WORKING ON THIS.

% Outputs the X, Y, Z coordinates of the CoM of a given q_state.
function[ xyz ] = Center_of_Mass( q_state ){
	% Calculate the X, Y, Z coordinates of each of the link's individual CoM.

	% Average all the links' ( mass * CoM ) and divide by the total mass of the links.

	xyz = [ 0 0 0 ];

	return xyz;
