function() = Output_q_Matrix()
	%Take initaial and final q-states
	%Initial state srom position Kinematics?
	%Final State from Inverse Kinematics
	%Give final q-matrix with all intermediate steps. So.. decide step size for each joint?

	%Q-Matrix has multiple rows which correspond to each transition i.e. bend knee, move foot, etc. These rows will be organized in the order of their execution. i.e. soem values may not change in each row. 

	%% Decide sequence of events that lead to knelt-down position
